# Who's the fairest of them all?

 
This repository provides a logistic regression implementation in Python for the fair classification mechanisms introduced in the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05259" target="_blank">AISTATS'17</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08452" target="_blank">WWW'17</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00010" target="_blank">NIPS'17</a> papers.

#### Keng Hwee's Summary Paper:
We have summarised the key ideas discussed in the three aforementioned papers into a final report: "Who's the fairest of them all?". The report is "final_paper.pdf".

#### Dependencies 
1. [numpy, scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html) and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) if you are only using the mechanisms introduced in [1].
2. Additionally, if you are using the mechanisms introduced in [2] and [3], then you also need to install [CVXPY](https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy) and [DCCP](https://github.com/cvxgrp/dccp).

#### Using the code

1. If you want to learn more about <ins>impact parity</ins> as described in [1], please navigate to the directory "disparate_impact".
2. If you want to learn more about <ins>mistreatment parity</ins> as described in [2], please navigate to the directory "disparate_mistreatment".
2. If you want to learn more about <ins>group-based, Pareto-optimal classifiers</ins> as described in [3], please navigate to the directory "preferential_fairness".
